"""Shared CC hook input parsing — the ONE place that knows the payload contract.

Why this exists: Claude Code delivers each hook's payload as **JSON on stdin**
(the documented contract). An earlier generation of Genesis hooks instead read a
``CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT`` environment variable that held *just the tool-input dict*.
Current Claude Code (2.1.x) does not set that variable, so every hook that read
it saw an empty value and silently fell open — the CRITICAL-path guard, the
push/merge gate, the destructive-``rm`` guard, and a dozen others all became
no-ops (verified live 2026-07-23). See docs/reference/cc-compatibility.md.

The two payload shapes this bridges:

* NEW (stdin, full payload)::

      {"hook_event_name": "PreToolUse", "tool_name": "Bash",
       "tool_input": {"command": "..."}, "tool_response": {...}, ...}

* LEGACY (``CLAUDE_TOOL_INPUT`` env, tool-input dict only)::

      {"command": "..."}      # or {"file_path": "..."}, {"url": "..."}, ...

``tool_input()`` returns the ``tool_input`` sub-dict for the new shape and falls
back to the payload itself for the legacy shape, so a single ``field(p, "command")``
call works under both — no hook needs to know which contract produced the data.

Stdlib-only and fail-open by contract: any parse/read failure yields an empty
dict, never an exception. Hooks must never crash CC.

# instead of breaking every hook at once, while still rejecting ``/``, ``\\``,
# ``.``, NUL and control characters.

    """Exit a guard whose MODULE-SCOPE imports failed, without failing OPEN.

    THE HOLE THIS CLOSES. ``run_guard`` converts an unexpected crash into exit 2,
    but it is called at the BOTTOM of a guard — an exception raised while the module
    is still importing never reaches it. Python exits 1, and CC's PreToolUse contract
    is "exit 2 blocks; ANY other code is a non-blocking error, so the tool RUNS".
    MEASURED on every guard wired to this function: poison one shared sibling and each
    goes exit 2 -> exit 1, with a healthy-tree control blocking at 2. The gate does not
    degrade; it VANISHES, silently, while the session still believes it is protected.
    Version skew between a worktree and the main tree is a real configuration here, not
    a hypothetical.

    THE POPULATION IS ENUMERATED BY A TEST, NOT BY THIS SENTENCE. An earlier version of
    this docstring said "all four guards that import ``shell_parse`` at module scope",
    and that was false by more than half — an AST walk found five more, three of them
    blocking guards, every one exiting 1 on a poisoned tree. ``grep`` cannot tell a
    guarded import from a bare one, which is how a careful reading still missed them.
    ``test_every_module_scope_shell_parse_importer_is_accounted_for`` now enumerates
    the population and fails on an unaccounted-for importer, so the count lives
    somewhere that can be wrong out loud.

    WHY A REGEX OVER RAW TEXT, which is normally forbidden in this repo. The shared
    parser is precisely what is unavailable — that is the whole premise — so there is
    nothing to parse with. This does not attempt to decide what the command MEANS. It
    asks the much weaker question "does the raw text mention a gated operation at
    all", and answers a mention with a BLOCK. Over-blocking in this state is a loud,
    overridable refusal; under-blocking is the silent bypass above. The asymmetry is
    the entire design, and it is why the answer is deliberately crude.

    FAIL DIRECTION IS CLOSED THROUGHOUT, matching ``run_guard``: if the payload cannot
    be read, OR carries no command to look at, we cannot prove the command is harmless,
    so we block rather than guess. Both halves matter, and the second one is easy to
    miss: ``read_payload`` NEVER raises (malformed JSON and empty stdin both return
    ``{}``), so an unusable payload does not reach the except-clause — it arrives here
    as an empty string that matches nothing and would exit 0. Every caller of this
    function is wired to ``PreToolUse``/``Bash`` only, where a payload without a
    ``command`` is a broken contract rather than a benign shape, so blocking it costs
    nothing real. Nothing here may raise — an exception in this function would reinstate
    the exit 1 it exists to prevent — so every step is wrapped and the bare-except
    fallback blocks.

    NO IN-BAND WAIVER IS HONOURED HERE, and that is the decision this function's first
    version got wrong. It accepted a guard's sigil as a bare substring of the raw text —
    which is not a waiver, it is the WORD appearing anywhere. MEASURED against the real
    guards on a poisoned tree: an unrecoverable `git clean` was allowed because a LATER
    segment named a file whose name contained the sigil, and the review gate was waived
    by the sigil sitting inside a quoted string in an earlier segment. Binding a sigil
    to the segment it waives is what the shared parser does — and the shared parser
    being unavailable is this function's entire premise, so re-deriving that binding
    here would be a second shell parser written precisely where the first one is known
    to be missing.

    So the recovery route is repairing the hook tree, which is the ACTUAL fix and is
    always available: nothing about a broken sibling module requires a commit to
    repair. ``git_push_guard`` already honoured no sigils on this path for the narrower
    version of the same reason — waiving a publish while every gate in that file is
    proven absent is the precise combination the net exists to prevent — and that
    argument was always true of the other three callers too.

    Args:
        name: guard name, for the operator-facing notice.
        gated: regex (searched case-insensitively against the RAW command text).
            Pass a literal pattern defined ABOVE the guarded import, so it is still
            bound when the import that failed is the one being recovered from.
        override_sigils: ACCEPTED AND IGNORED. No sigil is honoured here — see above —
            but the parameter stays, and the reason is the failure mode this whole
            module exists to prevent: the guards resolve from the MAIN tree while a
            worktree can hold a different copy, so an older caller can be paired with
            this newer helper. Removing the parameter turns that pairing into a
            ``TypeError`` at import time, which exits 1, which Claude Code reads as
            NON-BLOCKING. Deleting a parameter to tidy a signature would have
            reintroduced the fail-open through version skew — the exact configuration
            named at the top of this docstring as the reason the bug is reachable.
        also_lost: what this guard does BESIDES refusing, named on the allow path.
            A guard is not always only a gate: `git_discard_guard`'s main job is the
            recovery SNAPSHOT it takes before a discarding verb, and MEASURED on a
            poisoned tree, `git checkout -- .` exits 0 here with no snapshot taken —
            uncommitted work destroyed unrecoverably, under a notice that mentioned
            only "gates". Naming the loss is the difference between an allow the

    WHY THIS IS NOT THE NORMALIZATION THIS REPO FORBIDS, because it looks exactly like
    it and an earlier revision of this change refused to do it on those grounds. That
    rule is about normalising ahead of a BLIND-SPOT PROBE — a probe asks "could the
    parser read this", and preprocessing deletes the evidence it exists to find. This
    is not a probe. It is a crude text matcher standing in for a parser that is gone,
    and its whole job is to ask what the SHELL would run. Reproducing one step of the
    shell's own lexer is the opposite of hiding evidence from it.

    THE DEFECT THAT SETTLED IT, measured across all six wired guards: a continuation
    inside the gated TOKEN (`git cl\\<newline>ean -fd`) is removed by the shell and runs
    as `git clean -fd`, while a word-boundary matcher over the raw bytes sees `cl` and
    `ean` and refuses nothing. 6 of 6 allowed the split spelling of a command each
    refused whole. Dropping an adjacency conjunct — the earlier fix — closes the split
    BETWEEN tokens and does nothing for a split INSIDE one.

    DELETED, NOT REPLACED WITH A SPACE, and the distinction is load-bearing: `a\\<nl>b`
    is one word `ab` to the shell. #1547 shipped the fold-to-space version and it was
    itself the bug — it glued the wrong things together and allowed a destructive
    command. ODD-LENGTH RUNS ONLY: in an even run each backslash is escaped by its
    neighbour, so the last is a literal character and the newline after it really does
    separate two commands. Consuming escaped pairs as we walk makes that parity fall
    out with no counting.

    Quote-blind on purpose. A continuation inside quotes is NOT removed by the shell,
    so joining one here can only ever create a gated-looking token that does not run —
    an over-block, in a state whose entire posture is over-blocking. Tracking quotes
    would mean a quote model in the module whose premise is that the parser is gone.

#: units, and `hook_output.utf16_len` is deliberately unreachable from here — this module
#: is stdlib-only and imported bare by 19 hooks. So the safety comes from HEADROOM, not
#: from unit-correctness, and the honest statement is the measurement: an exception whose
#: text is 5,000 astral codepoints yields a 420-codepoint reason worth 820 UTF-16 units,
#: and a full stdout envelope of 5,139 against the measured 10,000 cap. Roughly 2x. At
#: 800 that margin would be gone, so do not raise this without re-measuring in the
#: harness's unit.

    """Deliver a degraded verdict and exit — and exit with `code` whatever happens.

    TWO CHANNELS, because they reach different readers and neither covers both cases:

    * stderr is delivered to the model on exit 2 and DISCARDED on exit 0 (Claude Code
      drops stderr from an exit-0 PreToolUse hook; ``git_discard_guard`` records the
      same constraint). So on the ALLOW path stderr alone is written to nobody, and a
      degraded guard looks exactly like a healthy one — which is the condition this
      whole change exists to make visible.
    * ``hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`` on STDOUT is the channel that IS
      delivered on exit 0. It is emitted only there: on exit 2 the reason already
      reaches the model, and a second copy is noise.

    EITHER/OR, not both, and a test asserts the allow path writes nothing to stderr.
    Writing both looks harmless and is not quite: on exit 0 stderr reaches nobody, so
    a second copy there is a notice that appears delivered while going nowhere, which
    is the failure this function is trying to stop rather than imitate.

    EVERY WRITE IS SUPPRESSED ON FAILURE and the exit still happens. If stderr or
    stdout is closed, a write raises ``OSError`` — and an OSError escaping here means
    Python exits 1, which Claude Code reads as NON-BLOCKING. A diagnostic that cannot
    be written must never decide a verdict.

    ``os._exit`` RATHER THAN ``sys.exit``, and the difference is the whole point of the
    paragraph above. ``sys.exit`` raises ``SystemExit`` and lets the interpreter shut
    down normally — which RETRIES the flush of any stream that failed above, and on a
    failure there CPython replaces the intended status with 120. 120 is not 2, so a
    broken stdout could still turn a block into a non-block after every write had been
    carefully suppressed. This is a short-lived hook process with no cleanup contract
    and nothing registered at exit, so leaving by the immediate door costs nothing and
    makes the exit code the one thing that cannot be taken away. Successful writes are
    flushed explicitly above, because ``os._exit`` will not do it.

    The message is bounded by CONSTRUCTION rather than by a cut here: it is fixed
    literals plus ``reason`` (clipped, with the cut declared) plus a caller-supplied
    ``also_lost`` literal. Nothing unbounded reaches it.

    option yields the parent). Recurses so multiple/nested groups expand. A
    token with no comma-brace returns ``[token]`` unchanged.

    Why the rm guards need this: bash brace-expands an unquoted target BEFORE
    ``rm`` ever runs, so ``rm -rf ~/genesis/{data,logs}`` deletes
    ``~/genesis/data`` — but a guard that inspects the single opaque token
    ``~/genesis/{data,logs}`` sees no glob, no exact/ancestor match, and a
    depth of 4, so it waves the command through. Expanding first makes each real
    target visible to the depth/protected checks.

    Numeric ranges (``{1..3}``) are deliberately NOT expanded — a rare shape for
    a deletion target. An absurd combinatorial blow-up (a brace bomb) raises
    ValueError; callers are run_guard-wrapped, so that fails CLOSED (blocks).
    Quote/expansion nuances are handled by shlex upstream, matching the sibling
