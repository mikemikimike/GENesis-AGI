"""Append-only audit records for hook logs: one FILE per flush.

Extracted from ``git_discard_guard.py`` when a second hook log — the merge gate's
override record — needed the same properties.

WHY ONE FILE PER FLUSH
======================
An earlier version of this module appended every row to a single shared JSONL and
maintained it in place: an exclusive lock on a sidecar, a tail-terminator check, an
age prune and a size trim that rewrote the file through a temp and an atomic replace.
That design produced five review rounds, and three of them introduced the defect the
next one found — every instance of one rule (hold a verified descriptor, then never
resolve the path again) plus a retention engine whose failure mode was destroying the
data it bounded.

Writing a fresh file instead removes the whole class rather than another instance of
it. There is no shared mutable file, so there is nothing to lock, no tail to inspect,
no inode to replace and no crash window between truncate and write. ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL``
on a name that does not exist yet cannot be redirected: a symlink or FIFO planted at
that name fails with ``EEXIST`` and the next candidate is tried. Retention moves to
``scripts/prune_hook_audit_logs.py`` on the daily ``disk_hygiene.sh`` timer, which is
where every other store in this repo bounds itself, and deleting whole old files is
the one retention shape a per-file store makes safe.

WHAT THIS GUARANTEES
====================
* **Own-user-only, with no umask window.** ``os.open`` applies the mode at CREATE
  time; ``open()`` then ``chmod`` is briefly group/world-readable. These files sit in
  ``~/.genesis`` beside secrets.
* **Two names per flush, each resolved exactly once, and neither is ever reopened.**
  The bytes go to a STAGING name (:data:`_STAGING_SUFFIX`), and the record is then
  PUBLISHED by hard-linking that inode to its final ``.jsonl`` name. ``link`` rather
  than ``rename`` because link fails ``EEXIST`` on a taken name instead of replacing
  what is there, which keeps the create-or-fail property the retry loop rests on.
* **A batch is one ``os.write``, or as many as the kernel needs to finish it.** All
  rows land or none do — for a CONCURRENT READER as well as for the writer, which is
  what the staging name buys: the ``*.jsonl`` glob that ``cat`` and ``backup.sh``
  both use can only ever match a complete record, and a mid-write kill leaves a
  scrap the pruner reaps rather than a truncated line that breaks the whole store.
* **Bounded work.** Serialisation happens before any filesystem call, and the row
  count is capped — see :data:`_MAX_ROWS` for why that is a security property here.
* **Failures are reported, never fatal.** A caller on a hook path must not break the
  user's command over an audit write, so every entry point returns ``None``/``0``
  instead of raising, and says so on stderr rather than swallowing in silence.

KNOWN RESIDUALS, stated rather than implied
===========================================
* The DIRECTORY is created with :data:`LOG_DIR_MODE`, but ``os.makedirs`` does not
  apply that mode to intermediate components and does not tighten one that already
  exists. The per-file 0600 mode is what protects contents; whether the directory
  listing is visible to other local users depends on the home above it.
* No ``fsync``. A crash immediately after a write can lose that flush. The previous
  design could lose the entire retained history to the same crash, because the
  atomic replace was what published it.
* Publishing needs HARD LINKS. On a store directory placed (via the env knob) on a
  filesystem that does not support them, every write fails — loudly, with a stderr
  warning and ``None``, never silently. That is deliberate: the alternative,
  falling back to ``rename``, would silently REPLACE whatever sits at the final
  name, so the degraded mode would destroy records instead of refusing to write
  them. The default store is an ordinary directory under ``~/.genesis``.
* Files are named from the wall clock plus pid. Two flushes in the same microsecond
  from one process take the retry suffix; the ordering the pruner relies on is the
  name, so a clock stepped backwards makes a NEW file sort as though it were old.
  The consequence is an out-of-order deletion — including, once the store is over
  its bound, of a recent record that is not yet in a backup. Naming is not a
  correctness boundary for the WRITE (no record is ever overwritten), but it is the
  pruner's only ordering signal, and this is the one case where it can drop the
  wrong one.

_NAME_RETRIES = 100

#: Suffix of the STAGING name a batch is written to before it is published.
#:
#: Deliberately not ``.jsonl``: the store's documented reader is
#: ``cat <store>/*.jsonl`` and ``backup.sh`` globs the same pattern, so a name the
#: glob matches is a PUBLISHED record by definition. Writing under this name and
#: publishing afterwards is what makes "all rows land or none do" true for a
#: CONCURRENT READER as well as for the writer — opening the final name first
#: exposes an empty file for the length of the write, and a mid-write SIGKILL
#: leaves a truncated line there permanently, which makes the whole store
#: unparseable (CodeRabbit Major + Codex P2, PR #1609).
#:
#: The cost of hiding a scrap from the glob is that it is also hidden from the
#: pruner, which would be a new unbounded store — so ``trim_dir_by_size`` reaps
#: stale scraps, under the same recency rule it applies to records.
#:
#: TWO limits of that reaping, stated because "unconditionally reaped" would be too
#: strong. Scrap bytes are NOT added to the size total, so the byte bound bounds the
#: records only and a store can sit somewhat over its nominal bound while live
#: scraps exist — bounded by the reap rather than by the trim. And a scrap that is
#: not a REGULAR file is skipped, exactly as a record is: neither is read nor
#: unlinked through, which is the property that matters more than reaping every
#: name. The grace window protects a STALLED writer, not structurally; a flush is
#: milliseconds, and the failure mode if a scrap is taken anyway is a reported
#: ``None`` (the publish raises ENOENT), never a record that silently vanishes.
_STAGING_SUFFIX = ".part"

#: Rows accepted in one flush. A caller notes one row per override sigil on one
#: command, so a real flush is one to four.
#:
#: This bound is a security property, not tidiness. A sibling helper on the same hook
#: path once did work proportional to the command's size, and on a long command that
#: cost enough to exceed a shell hook's registration timeout — the hook was killed
#: before its ``exit 2``, and a non-blocking exit lets the refused command RUN.
#: Serialisation here is linear rather than quadratic, but a cap keeps "no unbounded
#: work on a verdict path" true by construction instead of by argument.
