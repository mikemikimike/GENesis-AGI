# genesis-disk-hygiene — daily disk grooming entrypoint.
#
# Run by the genesis-disk-hygiene.timer systemd unit (also runnable by hand).
# Best-effort steps — one failing must not skip the others:
#   1. Reap merged/inactive git worktrees  → scripts/worktree_lifecycle.py
#      (trash-bin with 7-day recovery; frees space when trash purges)
#   2. Reclaim regenerable caches          → scripts/disk_reclaim.py
#      (cheap tier always; medium/reindex tier only when disk >= 90%)
#   3. Reap orphaned background-CC sandboxes (~/tmp/bg-cc-sessions, 24h)
#   4. Age-prune ~/tmp direct children (>7d, excluding bg-cc-sessions)
#   5. Label-aware attention-snapshot GC   → scripts/attention_snapshot_gc.py
#      (home >60d / OMI >14d, but NEVER a snapshot a labeled event references)
#   6. Retention prune of immunity_shadow_events (>45d) → scripts/prune_immunity_shadow.py
#      (WS-3 B1 observe-only gate log; bounds the shadow store)
#   7. Retention prune of capability_shadow_events (>45d) → scripts/prune_capability_shadow.py
#      (WS-5 Discord observe-only gate log; bounds the shadow store)
#   8. Retention prune of session_ledger_shadow_* (>45d) → scripts/prune_ledger_shadow.py
#      (session-manager PR-3 ambient extractor shadow store; runs + events)
#   8b. Retention prune of ~/.genesis/sessions/<id>/ (>60d, whole dirs)
#      (per-session state + SessionStart context mirrors; age far exceeds any
#      live session, which rewrites last_prompt_time every prompt)
#      COUPLING: observability/snapshots/context_injection.py uses a NON-EMPTY
#      ~/.genesis/sessions as its proof that CC has ever run here — the guard
#      that stops a blind scan reporting a false all-clear. Emptying this
#      directory silently disarms that guard, so 60d is load-bearing for the
#      injection watcher too, not only for disk. Read that code before lowering.
#   9. Retention prune of ~/.genesis/output/retrieval_efficacy/*.md (>45d)
#      (WS2-0 retrieval-efficacy report; dated md per run — file-age prune)
#  10. Retention prune of ego_proposal_revisions (ego_reconcile config window)
#      → scripts/prune_proposal_revisions.py (PR-5 reconcile revision audit)
#  11. Retention prune of pending_issue_posts terminal rows (>30d)
#      → scripts/prune_contributor_issue_posts.py (Contributor Work-Log hold
#      store; held rows never pruned)
#  12. Retention prune of entity_merge_journal (>180d) → scripts/prune_entity_merge_journal.py
#      (reversibility snapshot store; generous window so unmerge_entity outlives
#      the mis-merge discovery horizon)
#  13. Size trim of the hook audit stores (>5MB each) → scripts/prune_hook_audit_logs.py
#      (merge-override + git-discard records, one file per flush — oldest whole
#      files dropped; an age prune cannot bound an append-forever store)
#  14. Retention prune of ~/.genesis/output/guard-corpus.jsonl (>45d)
#      (the guard replay corpus and any temp an interrupted rebuild left; it is
#      regenerable, and it holds verbatim command lines — see prune_guard_corpus)
#
# Note: run under a hardened systemd sandbox (NoNewPrivileges, ProtectSystem=
# strict), so disk_reclaim's --system (/var, sudo) path is intentionally NOT

    #
    # Whole directories, by DIRECTORY mtime, at 60 days.

    # is false: a directory's mtime tracks entry creation/removal, NOT in-place
    # rewrites of the files inside it. `last_prompt_time` is written with
    # Path.write_text (truncate-in-place), so a live session does NOT keep
    # bumping its directory's mtime. "It cannot take a running session because
    # the dir mtime is minutes old" would be wrong.

    # dir mtime trails the newest contained file by at most ~1 day (588 dirs

    # the 161 dirs older than 60d, none held a file newer than 60d.

    # That margin is a SNAPSHOT, though, and it is not what the safety should
    # rest on: a session resumed after a long dormancy has an old directory
    # mtime and a brand-new last_prompt_time, and deleting it takes a LIVE
    # session's state. So take the predicate the paragraph above prescribes
    # instead of the margin that made it unnecessary — a directory is pruned
    # only when it contains NO file modified inside the window. Costs one extra
