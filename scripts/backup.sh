# every field (sigil, waived gate, PR, repo, head sha) means the same thing on a
# restored install, so the trail survives a rebuild intact. Plain copy, like the
# infrastructure profile above: the backups repo is private, and the writer
# refuses to persist command text, so these rows carry no credential material.
#
# The git-discard store is DELIBERATELY not here, and that is the whole reason this
# block names one store instead of globbing ~/.genesis. Its recovery payload is a
# `git stash create` sha that exists ONLY in the local repo's object store: such
# objects are never pushed, git prunes unreachable ones (default two weeks), and
# this script captures no object store at all. Restoring it onto a rebuilt
# container yields a list of pointers to nothing — a trail that LOOKS recoverable
# while every recovery attempt fails, which is worse than an absent one. At a live
# install, of 76 recorded shas one was already unresolvable in the repo that wrote
# it. Making it genuinely restorable means backing up the objects, not the records.
# ASK the writer where the store is; do not assume the default. An install that
# sets GENESIS_MERGE_OVERRIDE_DIR to a supported absolute path had its audit trail
# silently excluded here and restored to the wrong place — the trail lost on
