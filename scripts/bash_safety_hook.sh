#
# 2026-08 rewrite (guard-correctness PR):
#   * rm checks DELEGATE to the token-parsing Python guards
#     (scripts/hooks/destructive_command_guard.py + protected_paths_guard.py)
#     instead of substring globs — the old *"rm -rf /"*|*"rm -rf ~"*|*"rm -rf ."*
#     cases blocked rm -rf on ANY absolute path, ANY ~/ path, and ANY
#     .-prefixed relative (.venv, .pytest_cache): a standing false-positive
#     cluster. USER-APPROVED POLICY (2026-08-01): deep non-protected paths
#     (depth >= 4) are now deletable everywhere; shallow/broad targets and the
#     protected data dirs (genesis data/DB, transcripts, backups, snapshots,
#     browser profiles) stay hard-blocked. If the guards are unavailable or
#     crash, the legacy globs run instead (degraded, never open).
#   * force-push detection is scoped to the SEGMENT containing `git push`
#     (split on ; && || | and newlines) — `rm -f x && git push` is not a
#     force push. Residual (documented): the split is quote-naive, so a
#     separator inside quotes can hide a same-segment -f from THIS hook;
#     inside genesis the argv-based git_push_guard still catches it.
#   * the soft push/PR reminders and the gh-pr-merge gate are SKIPPED inside
#     the genesis repo for interactive sessions — the project-level
#     git_push_guard runs the same (richer) gates there, and the duplicate
#     cost 2x live gh API calls per merge (audit D4). Dispatched sessions
#     (GENESIS_CC_SESSION=1) keep this belt until project-hook coverage in
#     autonomous sessions is separately verified.

#
# DELIBERATELY OVER-MATCHING ON COMMAND POSITION — do not "fix" that. An earlier
# revision of this PR keyed the arm on command position so the phrase could not
# match inside a heredoc, a grep pattern or a commit message. Cross-model review
# found fail-OPEN bypasses in that version — a leading redirection
# (`2>/dev/null <cmd>`) and the `command` / `env` wrappers — that the crude form
# caught. The reason is structural, not a bug to patch: this arm runs SHELL-side
# in the global user-level hook with no access to the canonical tokenizer
# (scripts/hooks/shell_parse.py), so anchoring the COMMAND means modelling shell
# grammar with a regex. That is an open set, and the review loop finds one member
# of it per round without converging. Over-blocking there is friction;
# under-blocking risks the editable-install spiral that OOM-crashed this
# container on 2026-03-16, so friction is the correct side to err on.
#
# THE FLAG IS A DIFFERENT AXIS, and it is closed. "Is there a `-e` OPTION here?"
# is a claim about one whitespace-delimited word, decidable from the word alone
# with no grammar at all — so it neither buys nor costs anything on the axis
# above. The old predicate did not make that claim: `-e` was an unanchored
# SUBSTRING, so every long option whose name starts with `e` supplied one
# (`--extra-index-url`, `--exclude-files`, `--exists-action`), as did a package
# name with `-e` inside it (`pytest-env`). Because the `_gc`/`_gd` check below
# also fires when the CWD is a worktree, an ORDINARY pip command run from ANY
# worktree was hard blocked — MEASURED twice in one session, and a block discards
# the whole Bash call. The same blindness ran the other way: `-qe` / `-ve` are
# real editable installs carrying no literal `-e`, so the arm never saw them.
#
# Every spelling below was VERIFIED 2026-09-06 by running pip's own parser, not
# read off its --help: `-e X`, `-qe X`, `-ve X`, `-eX` (glued value),
# `--editable=X` and the abbreviations in the next paragraph all reach the
# editable code path. The optional quote lets `pip install '-e' .` keep matching,
# which the substring form covered.
#
# The LONG form is matched by the prefix `--ed`, not by the full spelling,
# because optparse accepts any UNAMBIGUOUS abbreviation and pip therefore really
# installs from `--ed`, `--edi`, `--edit` and `--editab` (MEASURED against pip's
# own parser, 2026-09-06: each reaches "not a valid editable requirement", i.e.
# the editable code path; `--e` is rejected as ambiguous). The old substring
# caught those by accident, since `--edit` contains a literal `-e`, so spelling
# out `--editable` here would have been a silent NARROWING of a hard block.
# `--editable` is the only `--ed…` option pip install has, so the prefix cannot
# collide; a hypothetical future pip that accepted a 3-character `--e` is the
# stated residual.
#
# The SHORT form has two clauses, and the split is the whole trick. A token
# STARTING `-e` is unambiguous: `e` is the first option letter, so whatever is
# glued after it is its value — no knowledge of any other flag is needed, which
# is what keeps this a closed-set claim rather than a model of pip's option
# table. A token where `e` is deeper in a BUNDLE (`-qe`, `-ve`) is ambiguous
# with a glued value that merely contains an e, so that clause borrows the shape
# the git-clean and force-push arms below already use — a run of letters that
# must END, at a blank, at end of line, or where a path-like value begins.
#
# MEASURED against a generated matrix of 158,312 command shapes, graded by pip's
# OWN parser (optparse with pip's option spec) rather than by another regex, so
# the grader is not the thing under test. Of the 36,499 shapes that really are
# editable installs, the old substring missed 16,635 (45.6%) and this predicate
# misses 11,994 (32.9%). BOTH directions, because a catch rate alone would hide
# the cost:
#   * real installs the old form caught and this one does not: 117 (0.07% of the
#     matrix) — all of them a BUNDLE with a glued value that is neither path-like
#     nor quoted (`-qepytest-env`). pip rejects such a value as "not a valid
#     editable requirement" anyway, and every worktree path starts with `/`, `.`
#     or `~`, which the terminator does cover.
#   * NEW false positives: 2,354 (1.5%) — a glued value on some OTHER short
#     option that happens to contain an e (`pip install -Urequests`). This is the
#     price of the bundle clause, and the bundle clause is what closes `-qe` /
#     `-ve`. Separating those two would mean knowing which short options take a
#     value, i.e. modelling pip's option table — the open set this file refuses.
# Both figures come from a generated matrix rather than real traffic, so they
# describe the predicate, not this install's command mix.
#
# The durable fix for the command-position axis is DELEGATION to a Python guard —
# the idiom this file already uses for rm and git-clean below, which is how those
# arms get the real tokenizer without leaving the shell. Filed as a follow-up
# rather than done inline, because it needs a guard that does not yet exist.

# inside a heredoc, a grep pattern or a commit message. Cross-model review found
# three fail-OPEN bypasses in that version, and replaying the same shapes against
# the sibling arm found more: a leading redirection (`2>/dev/null <cmd>`) and the
# `command` / `env` wrappers all slipped past the anchor while the substring form
# caught each one. (The bundled short flag reported alongside them belongs to the
# FLAG axis below, not this one, and is now closed on both arms.)
#
# The reason is structural, not a bug to patch. This arm runs SHELL-side in the
# global user-level hook, with no access to the canonical tokenizer
# (scripts/hooks/shell_parse.py), so it is modelling shell grammar with a regex.
# That is an open set: every named bypass is one member of it, and the review
# loop finds them one per round without converging.
#
# Over-blocking here is friction (a read-only `grep` for the phrase is
# refused); under-blocking loses uncommitted work in a worktree, which is
# unrecoverable. MEASURED on this arm: 5 of 8 probed shapes regressed from
# BLOCK to allow under the anchored predicate.
#
# Inside a genesis checkout the project-level worktree_cwd_guard.py already covers
# this with the real parser; this arm is the belt for everywhere else, where
# no project hooks are loaded.
#
# The FLAG, as in the pip arm above, is the one axis here that is closed and was
# wrong, in BOTH of its spellings.
#
# Short: `-f` used to require a LITERAL SPACE after it, so the shell's other word
# separators did not end the flag — a tab before the operand, or `-f` as the last
# word on the line, ran a forced removal and were allowed. It now ends at any
# blank, a quote, or end of line, and must START at one too, so the `-f` inside a
# path like `/tmp/wt-f` is no longer read as the flag.
#
# Long: `--force` is matched by the prefix `--f`, because git's parse-options
# accepts any unambiguous abbreviation. MEASURED 2026-09-06 on a scratch repo —
# `--f`, `--fo` and `--forc` each returned 0 and the worktree was really gone,
# while `--foo` was refused as an unknown option. `git worktree remove -h` lists
# `-f, --[no-]force` as its ONLY option, so nothing else can collide. The old
# predicate caught these by accident (`--f ` contains `-f `), so requiring the
# full spelling — or adding the leading blank without this clause — would have
# been a silent NARROWING of a hard block that exists because a forced removal
# destroys uncommitted work irrecoverably.
#
# Both are claims about one word and say nothing about where the command starts,
# so neither can reintroduce the command-position bypasses this arm was reverted
# over. MEASURED over a generated matrix of 18,018 shapes graded by git's own
# option grammar: of the 9,996 that really are forced removals the old predicate
# missed 3,927 (39%) and this one misses 0, with 0 real removals lost.

# git-discard safety (2026-08-24 recoverability redesign; the review loop proved

#   (1) reset --hard SPEED-BUMP — a dependency-free substring block, kept only as
#       a best-effort nudge. reset is RECOVERABLE (the snapshot net below undoes
#       it), so any spelling that dodges this substring is recovered, not lost.
#       Checked BEFORE the softer push/PR warnings below (a "git push" warning
#       exits 0 and would short-circuit a block).
#   (2) git_discard_guard.py — the PRECISE, quote-aware authority (invoked just
#       below): it SNAPSHOTS checkout/restore/switch/reset/rm/mv/checkout-index/
#       read-tree (advisory) and BLOCKS a non-dry-run `git clean` (clean is
#       UNrecoverable — `stash create` cannot
#       capture untracked files — so it keeps a real closed-set block, honoring
#       `# discard-override`). A coarse dependency-free clean block survives ONLY
#       as a python-LESS fallback there (the guard is stdlib-only, so that
#       fallback is an extreme edge). Making the guard authoritative — not a
