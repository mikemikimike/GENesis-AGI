"""Size retention for the hook audit stores.

Each store is a directory of small JSONL files, one per hook flush. This deletes the
OLDEST whole files until a store fits its byte bound, so the stores stay bounded on a
smaller disk. Invoked by ``scripts/disk_hygiene.sh`` (the genesis-disk-hygiene.timer);
also runnable by hand.

Retention lives HERE rather than in the writer deliberately. The previous design
pruned in-hook, on the merge and discard paths, and that retention engine was the
source of most of the writer's defects — a guard about to return a security verdict
was also rewriting a file. A per-file store is what makes the daily-timer shape work:
an age prune cannot bound an append-forever file, but deleting whole old files can.

Best-effort — a failure here must not skip other hygiene steps, and a store that does
not exist yet (no override or discard has ever happened) is a clean no-op.

    store — which the writers were still filling at the default path — grew with
